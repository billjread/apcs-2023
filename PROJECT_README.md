## Project Description
This Project is a game, "The Box", where you select a character (a capital letter) and you collect points within the box you spawn in. You can then use these points to improve variables, such as the size of your box or the value of the items you collect.
## What I learned
After this project, I learned how to use time in Java, specifically "currentTimeMillis()", and how to use it properly. In this case, I used it to keep the spawning system time-based so the player cannot spam buttoms to get items to spawn faster. I also learned how to properly use Scanners.
## How You Can Try It
You can try this game by opening up the code and running it. You'll know it works when you are asked to select your character.
