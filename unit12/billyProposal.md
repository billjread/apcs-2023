# Project Proposal: A Java Collection Game 
In this game, you will have a character that is put in a 2D box. Using java.time.*, items will be placed in random places in the box at random times, and it is the players job to collect them. These items will have different raritys, and they will allow the player to earn benifits, such as increasing the size of the box or increasing the pace at which items spawn into the box.

## Decomposition
1. Brainstorm the specifics of the game
2. Develope the classes the game will need
3. Polish up the interface

## I Will Learn
- Java Timers
- Java Scanners
